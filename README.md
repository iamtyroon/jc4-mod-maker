## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   Protato's EasiEdit v05.exe

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository or download the source code.
2.  Place `Protatos EasiEdit v05.exe` inside the `protato` directory.
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python run_jc4_mod_gui.py
    ```

## üéÆ Workflow

1.  **Select a Vehicle:** Choose a vehicle from the list in the application.
2.  **Convert to XML:** Click "File to XML" to silently convert the vehicle's `.ee` file to `.xml`.
3.  **Edit:** Modify the `vehicle_misc_esi.xml` file in the built-in editor. You can also apply quick mods.
4.  **Convert back to EE:** Click "XML to file" to silently convert your modified `.xml` files back to a complete `.ee` file.
5.  **Deploy:** Click "üöÄ Deploy" to automatically install your modded vehicle into the game.
6.  **Done!** Your vehicle is now ready to be tested in Just Cause 4.

## üîß Troubleshooting

*   **Vehicles not spawning:** This is often caused by incomplete `.ee` files. This tool avoids that by using Protato to process all 300+ vehicle components, ensuring a complete and functional file.
*   **Protato GUI appearing:** This tool uses a special batch file wrapper to run Protato silently in the background.
*   **Tree display crashes:** This has been fixed by correctly updating the tree view.

If you encounter any other issues, please check the following:
*   Ensure `Protatos EasiEdit v05.exe` is in the `protato` folder.
*   Verify that the vehicle's path in the settings is correct.
*   Try running the application as an administrator.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

This tool uses a batch file to execute Protato's EasiEdit silently. It redirects the. input and output to prevent any GUI elements from appearing. The tool also manages the file structure, ensuring that all necessary files are in their correct locations.
